Tips for keeping the project running smoothly:

Things to remember about Git... PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT:
    - Always pull the latest before doing any work
    - Always merge master into your local branch before pushing
      so conflicts can be resolved locally and quietly
    - preferably always work on a separate branch,
      then merge code into master after a pull request
    - be cautious when resolving conflicts
    - Tools like PyCharm can make it a lot easier to resolve conflicts
    - Doing a diff between branches can be super helpful
    - Be careful with anything other than commit, push, and pull 

Things to remember about packages:
    - This project is a package
    - Never use relative imports
    - Instead do use this format -> from package.module import class
        e.g security_simulation.security_agent import SecurityAgent
    - when using an IDE like PyCharm mark security_simulation directory as
      sources root
    - when running from command line or Canopy you must pip install the package
      every time a change is made, see below for instructions

HOW TO INSTALL THIS PROJECT:
 1. from a terminal change directories to SecuritySimulation
 2.  run command 'pip install .'

TESTING
    Install pytest
    Terminal: should already be installed if you pip installed the package
    PyCharm: go to Settings-->Python integrated tools --> Testing(subsection)
             change default test runner to pytest (pytest needs to be installed
             in your project's interpreter)
    Run pytest from commandline or from PyCharm in project directory

Things to remember about python:
    - Flake8 is your friend https://pypi.org/project/flake8/ it makes it easy
      to follow proper python style and syntax
    - PyCharm makes your life so much easier https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download
