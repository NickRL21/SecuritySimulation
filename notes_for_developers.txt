    - This project is a package
    - Never use relative imports
    - Instead do this from package.module import class
        e.g security_simulation.security_agent import SecurityAgent
    - when using an IDE like PyCharm mark security_simulation directory as
      sources root
    - when running from command line or Canopy you must pip install the package
      every time a change is made, see below for instructions
